This "Website" was created using Nicepage as a test

To host this site locally using raspberry pi you will need "Apache2". You can install it using
```
sudo apt install apache2
```

After you installed it you can go to ```/var/www/``` and put the website files in there. Then you can access the site using raspberry pi's IP address
