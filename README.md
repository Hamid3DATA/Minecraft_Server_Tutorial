The files you find under "[files](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Minecraft_Server_Tutorial/tree/main/files)" folder were created using Nicepage as a test.

The page i made myself are under the folder named "[my_files](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/Minecraft_Server_Tutorial/tree/main/my_files)".

To host this site locally using raspberry pi you will need "Apache2". You can install it using
```
sudo apt install apache2
```

After you installed it you can go to ```/var/www/html/``` and replace the index file with the website files you just downloaded. You can then access the site in your browser by using raspberry pi's IP address.
