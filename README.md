The files you find under "files" folder were created using Nicepage as a test.

The page i made myself are under the folder named "my_files".

To host this site locally using raspberry pi you will need "Apache2". You can install it using
```
sudo apt install apache2
```

After you installed it you can go to ```/var/www/html/``` and put the website files in there. Then you can access the site using raspberry pi's IP address.
